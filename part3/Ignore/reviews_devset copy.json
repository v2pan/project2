I looked for a leak, and rationed that I probably lost the oil because the ground is uneven and the rudimentary air hole in the oil plug lets oil out if it is pointed down hill.I added oil and worked the summer. At the end of the summer, same story, several quarts low. I added more oil and did not observe any leak while it was running, but did observe oil under the oil tank.This year I let it to my nephew who brought it back to my house and I put it in my garage. Voila, I saw an oil leak. Using a light I found the leak was a 1.5\" crack in the tank under the engine. I contacted Troy Bilt and told them what I told you. They will not warranty this work and told me to take it to a certified Troy Bilt repair center who quoted me nearly $800 to repair it.It is unfortunate this company does not support customers any better than this. Had I put this splitter on concrete two years ago, I would have found the leak while still under warranty. Even though I reported the leaking oil occurred during the warranty period, and only found the leak last week, they still won't warranty it. This is sad because Troy Bilt used to be something you could buy with confidence, but apparently not anymore. There are too many reports of inadequate welds and cracking tanks to recommend this splitter to anyone. Certainly the hydraulics still work good, but a leaking tank is just plain a bad idea.PaulWhen I researched log splitters, I settled on Troy-Bilt. I examined three models and chose the 33 ton splitter for its power, design and of course the reputation Troy-Bilt has. It comes with a Honda 8 HP engine, which on other slitters is an expensive upgrade.I read the review about it being shipped in parts. I ordered it and found the instructions to actually being helpful. Very well thought out and engineered, I put it together in about 4.5 hours, from the time I opened the crate to when I split the first log. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in a splitter and Amazon's price is the best on the market. I do recommend you have an assistant in putting it together, although one person can assemble it. Please note you also need 8 gallons of hydraulic fluid, not seven. You have to allow for the hoses, cylinder, and filter.I finally got a chance to use it on some 24-30 inch dried cottonwood logs. Impressive is all I have to say. Cottonwood tears, not splits and the family splitter couldn't touch this stuff. This splitter tore right threw it. When it hit nasty narly wood, the ram slowed down and continued on. The auto return feature also is a nice touch, it retracts while you get another piece. I have no regrets and look forward to taking it out in the spring to split the other 10 - 12 cords of hardwood. Right now there is 3 feet of snow on the ground so this will unfortunately have to wait until spring.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Amended I love it", "unixReviewTime": 1168732800, "reviewTime": "01 14, 2007", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

Simmons", "helpful": [4, 4], "reviewText": "After my long lasting Troy-Built push lawn mower died, I decided to buy a new one instead of getting it fixed.  After reading and researching on-line reviews for self-propelled lawn mowers it seemed they started in the price range around $300.  I had never had a self-propelled mower before.  But, the thought that if the wife or kids wanted to volunteer mowing our small yard a self-propelled mower would make it a more enjoyable experience.Several features I was looking for were: (1) Larger rear wheels, (2) Dependable engine, (3) Decent warranty, (4) Variable speed drive.  This mower has all these except the variable speed, which was not a problem for me since a little downward pressure on the handle will make the front wheels lift off and slow it down if needed.  With the larger rear wheels it seems to accomplish this and turning fairly well.  Also, this is the &lt;&lt; ONLY >> mower in this price range that has a dependable HONDA engine.  Looking at the reviews of more expensive mowers, the HONDA engines were a major selling point considering their ease of starting and dependability.  Some of the reviewers here at Amazon had indicated they had problems with that engine.  For the price to value features of this mower, I was willing to take a gamble.This last weekend it was delivered to our doorstep. The time it had taken since my old mower had died and it arrived had been a little over two weeks.  The lawn looked like a jungle and I was in a hurry to get it mowed before the neighbors started to complain.  Probably should have taken the time to read the instructions first before I assembled and started it though.To start off, there were only 4 bolt/wing nuts to make up as a previous reviewer had indicated. A mistake I made was not putting them in the correct direction since the grass collection bag interfered with the lower ones until I turned them 180 degrees about.  The instructions probably would have told me this if I had read them.  Also, the oil that came in the bottle was just a tad more than the capacity of the oil reservoir.  DON'T OVERFILL a gas engine.  Luckily, I checked the dip stick and saw that it was a little overfull after dumping the WHOLE bottle in.  I emptied a little oil out until the dipstick showed the correct level and continued the startup process by filling the gas tank.At that point I had to get the manual out to see a picture of which way the gas shut-off valve should be pointed.  Also, the spark plug wire had to be attached to the spark plug.  OK... ready to fire her up.  I turned the throttle to choke and gave a couple of tugs.  Nothing.  Huh, maybe I got a dud like the previous reviewer on Amazon.  A couple of more uneventful tugs and I realize the carburetor was flooded with gas.  So, I took the air filter off to let the carburetor air out.A few minutes passed and I replaced the air filter.  A couple of more tugs proved uneventful.  Wow, I stood back in thought looking at the new lifeless piece of equipment I had put so much hope and anticipation in.  Then it dawned on me, I may have to hold the top lever on the handle back when I was pulling the starting cord.  I turned the throttle to medium, held one hand on the \"kill switch\" lever on the handle and pulled the cord.  The engine burst to life!  If only I had taken the time to read all the instructions, I probably would have had a more successful startup.Nah, I knew what I was doing?  Besides I had a jungle to mow.  The jungle is gone now and I am very confident in this machine to perform well for me in the future.  I even went out a couple of days later while writing this review to test it to see if it started again.  I turned the throttle to \"choke\" and with one tug it started again.  Also, I noticed the throttle move on it's own down to a run position instead of the \"choke\" position after it started.  Very cool.Who knows maybe the wife and kids will use this thing?  If nothing else, they can start it for me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "What an Exceptional Value!", "unixReviewTime": 1123977600, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2005", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

Last summer I had just decided that gardening was out for the following season because it just broke my back leaning over or sitting on the ground (even with a pad) and I would be unable to move for days after being outside and working.  This past year I got proactive (I have a HUGE yard and a garden with tons of unwelcomed visitors).  I read the reviews here and decided on this rocker style chair.  SO HAPPY!Why:  It is insanely comfortable.  It has a nice water, dirt and and clumsy/rough behavior resistant fabric and construction, enough cushion, ergonomic rump molding and tilts plenty far forward, sideways and back (while feeling perfectly safe and stable) to get my garden work done.I did not once feel like I was going to tip or that it was going to fly out from under me.It is incredibly durable and very convenient.  It slid and ground into gravel all spring and summer at least 4 days per week for at least a half day at a session without showing any real wear (even on the bottom plastic).  I shoved weeders,scissors, clippers, hand trowels etc. into the pockets and they are in good condition.  No holes, frays... nothing.  There is also storage on the bottom so there is no need for lots of ups and downs (a bonus for the back).  It is light enough to carry by the handle (fabric in back) by one hand and carry a trash can in the other no problem.I also use it when washing the dog in the tub.I can garden day after day with this thing (with occasional stretches) and feel pretty darn good at the end of the day.Also - I was originally wanting a chair that had wheels.  So glad I did not go that way.  I would have been sinking in the dirt and grass, it would not have survived the gravel and this thing (although I am sure they do not recommend it) can scoot easily while still under you.

We purchased the Meco 9309W deluxe grill and could not be happier. In a nutshell, it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. The grill is small enough that we can store it in our apartment. It is unobtrusive and fits so easily in a spare corner that you wouldn't even know it was there. When we want to use it we simply put it out on our (very) small porch and can actually grill from inside. (Note: this is not an indoor grill.)Though the grill is electric, it cooks very much like a gas grill. Depending on what you are cooking, flareups and smoke can occur, but they make the food taste even better. Grease drips into the bottom of the grill, where there is a small hole for drainage. However, you need to put something beneath to catch the excess. I wish that the sellers would supply a small cup to catch the drippings, as there is a space for one, but a cup made of aluminum foil works just as well and is easy to clean up.The Meco grill is well made and cooks wonderfully. I use it several times a week (sometimes twice a day on weekends). It has plenty of space, so I can cook enough meat and vegetables for four or more people simultaneously. I have not yet used the rotisserie feature, but based on my experiences thus far I am sure it would produce great tasting food.For such a wonderful grill, the price was very reasonable; also, grilling has not increased our electric bill, so it seems comparable to using the oven/stove. I love the Meco grill and look forward to many more years with it.

It is sturdy, maneuverable and versatile. All four of the tires required additional air pressure which can only be done with a manual pump per the users manual. But I used my electric emergency tire pump from the trunk of my car. Just keep in mind that due to the low volume of air in the tires they fill up fast - don't go to the gas station! There is a little confusion about the correct psi for the tires (manual says one thing and tires sidewall says another). Use the lower. Shipping box arrived in OK condition, not perfect. But there were no parts missing. Assembly takes awhile (and more tools than the manual states - screw driver and plyers aren't going to get the job done). Ratchet set needed if you don't want a \"repetitive motion injury\"!

Our reasoning for purchasing this controller is we have two homes.  Our primary home is on the east coast and the home we wanted to use the new controller on is in our residence in Arizona.  Our main purpose for such a controller was to have the ability for our landscaper to adjust our watering schedule on the fly and for us to monitor those changes remotely.  We also wanted the ability to know the amount of water our landscape uses.When we purchased the controller, we had only a week to install and test the unit before we needed to return to the east coast. We initially  tested the unit with the gateway indoors and it communicated perfectly.  However, once we placed the unit outside, made the connections and turned it on, the display failed.  We contacted Cyber-Rain and explained what happened and also told them that we were under a time crunch to  get the unit install along with a  flow sensor and test it before we left.  Due to the time crunch, they overnighted a new controller.  Their sales and support staff answered all questions on the flow sensor and the installation of the controller.The controller and flow sensor work just as we had hoped.  Our landscaper can program the watering needs of our shrubs and trees.  We can remotely check the water flow and usage, as well as how often our plants are being watered.  We are very pleased with our purchase and would highly recommend this controller.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Cyber-Rain Outdoor Residential Controller w/Cloud Technology", "unixReviewTime": 1384819200, "reviewTime": "11 19, 2013", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

Thomas III", "helpful": [3, 5], "reviewText": "I bought a DuroMax 10,000 Watt Generator from [...]  Model #XP10000e a while ago and have never had to use it up until now. It is capable of 120 volt operation and or 220 volt operation.Many people have told me that it's not possible to get simultaneous 240 & 120 from the generator but I'm here to tell you that it is possible and works extremely well.After some trial and error I figured out that it is possible to use the single 50 Amp, 4-Pole outlet to achieve a Simultaneous 240 / 120 Volt Wiring Harness.Wire the male 240 V / 50 Amp plug properly. Green (ground) on top pole. Red & Black (hot) go to either of the side poles. White (common) goes to the bottom pole.220 Volt Outlet is wired without a common (white) wire. Connect the red & black wires to either side of the outlet. Also connect the green (ground) to the outlet.Using the white wire, go to the 110 volt outlets. Make certain that you connect the outlets (look on the back of the outlet) to the common pole.Using the black and or red (hot = 120 volts each) connect to the hot pole on the 120 volt outlets. Use ONLY one or the other per outlet or you will have 220 rather than 110.Ground all outlets using the green or bare wire.This is an isolated setup ( No Back-Feeding )and does not connect to any part of your home's wiring. In my case, I drilled a 3/4\" hole through the wall and ran the main cable (8 gauge, 4 strand) outside making certain to leave plenty of slack to get to the generator while having enough left inside to make all my connections. I located the 1st connection (220 Volt) very close to the hole I drilled and mounted an outlet box to the wall for the A/C. Then I mounted a larger box beside it, to make my connections. From the larger box I have two smaller boxes connected using 12 gauge, 3-wire, to connect the 110 volt outlets.Check it out and maybe you can help others that have wanted / attempted to use more of the power that it harnessed in a larger generator like this one.I tested the setup with a 220V, 25,000 BTU A/C and several 110V items, including two shop-vacs. With everything going at the same time the voltage needle remained well within the operating range of approx. 220 Volts.Now that Irene is upon all of us on the eastern seaboard, I'm happy that I bought this generator.

It's not like any of them safely capture mice so they can be set free in the wild.  Like all mouse traps, it's basically a killing machine.  But at least this one can be reused again and again, and emptied with little fuss or creepy-crawly feelings!  I agree, however, that this may cost a lot in batteries.  But I actually prefer battery operated, over plugging it into a wall outlet.  If you have mice, the trap needs to go where the mice are, not where the nearest outlet happens to be.  It certainly beats those old style traps that always snap my fingers!UPDATE 7/18/11 - Good News/Bad News --- this thing just caught another mouse; which means we have more mice than i thought.

The amount was ample for 15 feet of heat tape (I know it is confusing, but the heat tape is the black plastic covered heating element that this tape I am reviewing positions against the pipe to be heated). I applied it every six inches (sometimes 4 inches on pipe curves) and even had some left over.This tape has a backing. This paper backing must be removed prior to applying the tape to the pipe. This can be tricky in a crawl space because you have to pull each tape section (precutting sections makes applying easier and can be done before you get in the crawl space) off the backing and then apply it to the pipe and heat tape with the heat tape firmly against the pipe. It's impossible to do that with gloves on (you need the gloves for the insulation application later on). Make sure you circle the tape over itself to make sure it won't lose it's grip.Remember, the tape is the device that keeps your electrical element (heat tape) up against the pipe! If your heat tape has large gaps where it isn't touching properly, you will use more elctricity because it will take longer for the pipe to get to 45 degrees and the heat tape will wear out sooner because it's on more often. Don't skimp on applying this tape!Finally, do some math on the length of your pipe and how many strips of tape to precut BEFORE you get in the crawl space. Take the tape sections and the rest of the tape and some scissors in a small plastic bag with you.

Honestly, I am so glad that I did, because it has made my life so much easier.

It doesn't take much force, and you'll be able to feel that the blades have gone all the way into the dirt, and then you can immediately pull up on the handle, sliding your foot down to the end of the peddle/lever as you do so, and it's out, usually roots and all!  If you go off-center, you can usually repeat the process and extract the remainder.  It's actually kind of fun for a while, and the only time I have a problem, is when the dandelions grow in a cluster, then it sometimes takes me a little longer to judge their centers, but that's not the fault of the tool.  Because I'm using my hands, with the aid of my foot on the pedal/lever, there's kind of a pivot action going on, which eliminates all resistance on the part of the plant, so there is no exertion on my part, and nothing to bother my injury.

It came with the switch, leads and pad. Mine Is setup for natural gas. It is close ( 3 ft or so) behind our house as code required. The unit is now 2 years young and works great. Sure you can hear it running but it is not that bad, especially since it comes on seconds after a power failure. No more house full of flashlights and extra batteries or having food go bad. It is large enough to handle our Ac unit. We've had about 7 or 8 times where it ran for at least a few hours and once for 3 days.Maintenance is easy since the oil filter and drain are easily accessible. My only wish would be for hydraulic tappets since the solid ones that it uses must be adjusted. The front is easily accessible while the rear is a bit of a stretch. All in all a few hours work at a lazy pace.I also purchased extra main fuses for the main switch panel (yes cartridge fuses) and also for the single auto type fuse on the outside unit - but I have never had one gone bad. They are just more peace of mind.Lastly I will talk about Generac service. It came with the side door lock jammed, one phone call and the new one was here in a few days. I have since called them a few times with questions, mostly about maintenance and they were always professional.

Yes, it does help in killing and controlling termite infestations. This is only a tool to kill and control the termites outside within the grounds around your home. You will also need to kill the nests within any wood structures as necessary...I recommendOrtho Home Defense Termite & Destructive Bug Killer - 32 oz. 0194260to treat and kill colonies in walls, floors and window frames. Look for toothpick sized holes dispersing wood particles. You may have to drill the hole larger and saturate with termite killer. I use a garden pump-sprayer with termite killer mixture and spray directly in the termite holes. Holes should be filled with caulking or re-plastered & re-painted to seal in termite killer. The killer should remain effective for years.I have a small apartment complex that had a serious termite infestation. I initially hired a professional which eliminated some termites but the infestation arose again the next year. When I called back for warranty re-treating, the professional did re-treat the areas originally treated but stated any other areas are new colonies and not covered by the warranty. Rather than spend hundreds more for a new treatment, I chose to educate myself on the life of the (btw blind) termite.Termites can live 25 years and must start a nest with two asexual termites. One becomes the male and one becomes the female queen. They reproduce drones with one purpose, to feed their queen. She remains stationary within the nest and can become 25 times larger in size...a real fat mama! If her male partner should die, one of the drones gets the privilege to be her new sexual boy-toy.Anyway, I learned subterranean termites need moisture to live and reproduce. These termites feed on plant/tree roots and then swarm (usually in seasonal hot weather) outside the ground and travel to nearby wood structures to form nests. These are the termites that destroy your home. These are the colonies that, most importantly, need to be controlled and killed.If you get the picture, the termite stakes are used to control and kill the subterranean termites outside your home and the spray mixture is used to control and kill the nests within wood.When I first used these stakes about 10 years ago, there was no \"pop-up\" indicator. I just know these were working since the swarms dissipated. These stakes last about a year killing termites unless there is an excessive amount of water washing away the chemical. Still, within the ground, the chemical helps kill termites. It did take me two (15) stake treatments in the course of 18 months to get the subterranean termites under control and several spray treatments in the various apartments and wood structures around the complex to get control of the termites. Now, I just watch for any new nests and treat accordingly.In closing, this product works to help kill and control termites.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Subterranean Termite Killer...Helps to Kill/Control Termites & Ants", "unixReviewTime": 1313712000, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2011", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

I trained with them all winter, in and out of cold water, carrying crud, in the mud, climbing ropes, etc. They have a GREAT grip (when dry). When these things get wet, grabbing onto metallic objects will be more slippery than going bare handed. For monkey bars in the TM, I'd suggest taking these off. I did and got right across. For going over the walls and up the quarter pipe, these things rule. I've also used them for minor construction projects and they are pretty good, protecting my hands and reducing vibrations from sanders and the like. One odd thing though, for me, the thumb fits a bit odd. I've had two pairs of these, one large, one medium, and the area between the index finger and the thumb feels short and tight, as if made for people with really short thumbs. Strange, but not necessarily uncomfortable, and will stretch out it seems after a while. People with super large hands will want the Large/X-large size.Pros: EXCELLENT grip when dry. GREAT fingertip protection. Good knuckle protection. Light and responsive. They also drain pretty well if you open and close tight fists, the water comes right out. Really inexpensive. Decent grip with organic material (ropes, wood, etc) when wet.Cons: Can be hard to take off when wet. Slippery with metallic objects when wet. Grip surface can wear out pretty fast.Bottom line: These are really good gloves and you can't beat the price.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good choice for Tough Mudder", "unixReviewTime": 1337212800, "reviewTime": "05 17, 2012", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

This mower does not deal with debris well, as mentioned in the manual.  I have hit some utility marker flag bits left behind and it sounds painful for the mower and causes some gouging of the blade.That said, here are its great qualities:1. My shoes don't turn green.  Seriously, the cut of this thing is like a pair of scissors.  It's supposed to be the fastest healing for the grass, and doesn't cause so much browning.2. It's quiet.  I've cut grass at 6AM without upsetting the neighbors.3. No pollution.  Seriously.  Lawnmower engines have tended to pollute more in an hour than your car driving 600 miles.

So this year we decided to upgrade (from 1200 gpm cartridge to 1600 gpm sand filter) and after only running it for a couple of days we are amazed at the pump power and clarity of the water.The setup was quite simple, we used the inlet and outlet mounts from the original pump (as they were identical) so we didn't have to lower the pool level. Basically filling the kettle with sand and fastening all the piping and control valve. Backwashed and rinsed new sand as per directions and started filtering within 10 minutes.After running for about 6 hours we needed to backwash (pressure gauge shows when it is needed) as our pool water was new and we had iron sediment to clean out from our Sequa-Sol treatment. Started to backwash and could not believe the \"ick\" that came out from the filter. Once it ran clear, we switched off and back to regular filter. The discharge power was back as strong as could be.This filter is amazing. Any doubts/concerns that we had about the expense being worth it are GONE.

So I went hunting for the best all-stainless natural gas portable out there, and I think I found it. For starters, the parent company, Onward Manufacturing, has been around about as long as me and has grown and morphed into one of the major contenders. They make and distribute other brands including Weber, but the Imperial line is the hands-down winner based an cost and features. And they're made in America.Everything except the cart box is solid stainless, including the double layer hood, the burners, reflectors and grates. It comes partially knocked down but is easily assembled with a #3 philips in about an hour. The instructions are all pictographic, so you don't need a degree in engineering to understand them. It comes complete with a back burner and rotisserie (both easily removed), three large drawers and even interior lights. The natural gas flex line and connections fittings are also included.

I stumbled across Wooly Pockets and decided to give them a try. I have had them about 3 weeks now and they are well made. I bought the mini which I was able to put 2 small plants into. I think once the plants grow larger and cover up the pocket they will look great. If you purchase these, make sure you follow the set up instructions carefully. You are supposed to soak the root ball of the plant in water before putting in the wooly pocket; I missed this step and just poured some water inside, and then the water started dripping thru the fabric in the front. If you follow the watering directions correctly, they do not leak. I like the fact that they are made in USA using recycled water bottles as well. Thanks Wooly!10/29/12 UPDATE: I have had this product a few months now and I feel like I can review it more accurately now. I really wanted to like this product, but I just haven't had very good luck with it. Initially I watered like the directions stated; about 1x per week. It is hard to water these properly; I realize you are to keep the water to the back side or tongue, but still it either rolls over the top of the soil or leaks thru the fabric easily if you give it a little too much. I thought my home was too dry as the water rolled over the soil so I tried to water a little more frequently but sill no luck. The first set of plants died in each of these; now I replaced one but the other one is hanging on my wall with dead plant leaves in it. I think part of the problem is that I bought the mini size; I think it is just too small for the plant to grow and be watered in properly. Also I wish the front of the pocket was lined as well to avoid and water leakage.

The normal assortment of suburban trees, bushes, a swing set, raised garden, and detached garage. If I were reviewing the quality of yard I would give it a 2.5 out of 5. It is uneven, has 4-6 varieties of grasses and weeds each equally making up an equal percentage of the lawn. It has a small hill as well. Not the perfect set up for a push reel mower but certainly a perfect test for one.Set up was easy and it took me about 15 minutes. 11mm and 18mm socket are the only two tools needed. You build the handle and attach the small rear wheels and away you go. Mower itself is heavy, in a good way. Handle has several adjustment points and it worked well for me at 6'3\" at the longest setting. The mower pushes easily. The blades on mine at least were perfectly adjusted out of the box. In addition to the paper instructions included, there is a video I saw on the Fiskars site showing you how to adjust the blades if needed. Unit seems to be very robust and of a good quality.I set mine to cut fairly high as the grass was longer and I didn't want to leave a trail of long cut grass to rake up. The mower worked very well with grass and weeds with-in a inch or so of the height setting. Stuff that was a bit longer, like dandelion flower shoots or long wispy grass it tended to miss some. Not so much of the grass but more so the dandelion shoots. Overall though it did quite well on all parts of the lawn. The nicer parts of the lawn with the thickest and nicest grass, it did the best on. My neighbor actually came over and looked at it when I was out and commented that it seemed to be doing a very nice job as well.It doesn't cut with the same width as my gas mower and it took my a couple of passes to get the set up right so I wasn't missing a small strip between rows. It also doesn't cut when you aren't push forward so areas under things where you can kind of stick a gas mower and move it around, were a bit harder to deal with. Ditto for going around trees as I found a straight forward motion worked best and going in a circle was possible, just a bit harder to maintain the blade spin. I will just need to weed whip a little more of the yard when using the reel mower. I also never had any problem with it getting an obstruction that stopped it at all, despite my lawn having a some twigs and sticks. That might have been to to the height setting, but I could every so often hear something getting crunched and the mower blades kept on spinning.It is very quiet and less messy then a gas mower. I wore a pair of flip flops and my legs were very clean afterwards and the shoes didn't pick up any green staining like you would see after using a gas mower. Same workout to push around as the gas mower I have (non assisted type) but that isn't a bad thing as I enjoy the exercise. Having done the lawn once now, it did come out looking good overall even if it left some of the dandelion stalks. I do think I will be more prone to grabbing it on short notice and pushing it around to stay on top of things vs. the gas mower just because it is so simple and quiet. It won't replace my gas mower for 100% of my mowings, but it will be doing the vast majority of them going forward. Overall very happy to have it and would recommend it.Update: Have used it three times now without using the gas mower in between. It is doing a great job. Was able to get out this morning at 0730 and get the yard done without worrying about waking the neighbors. Can also talk to my daughter who likes to walk along side me.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Quiet, easy to push, and works well", "unixReviewTime": 1337385600, "reviewTime": "05 19, 2012", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

So much for an easy setup. You will have to give them all your personal information in registrating the product before they will send you the software via e-mail. You will have to find UPC codes and serial numbers as well. After you install new batteries in the floating sensor and plug the reciever, you will be instructed to wait for the \"signal bar\" to register full strength. Unfortunatly, I only recieved a signal strength of 68% while holding the sensor near the reciever. Once I put the sensor in the pool less than 15 feet away, I was now getting a signal strength of 53%. It was now transmitting the pool temp, ORP, and PH. There was no chlorine reading, just a blank line. Everything else looked right, but it would now require a 4 hour \"stabilization process\". The process lasted for two hours and then lost the signal from the sensor and it was in a state of permanent limbo. It's pretty obvious this thing has a poor transmitter with little or no range. I never did get a chlorine reading and I wasted a whole Sunday on this stupid thing. The toll free customer assistance is Monday thru Friday 9am to 5pm. I'll be at work during those times, so that's not helpful at all. There are plenty of calibration settings were you can reset the radio transmission and recalibrate each reading, but it warns you it is only for \"advanced users\".The idea of this product is very neat, but obviously it's more trouble than it's worth.

I always feel a bit guilty though that I don't pay enough attention to their water needs and it can get hot and dry here by July. I have a bird bath, but I'm not great at keeping it filled. For those reasons, this little water cooler for birds really appealed to me.I have to say I'm more than pleased with the quality and the design. First, it's very rugged and I don't think that, even if it fell from the hook where I have it hanging, that it would get hurt. Also, its very simple to use--just unscrew the base, fill it with water, re-attach the base and (quickly) flip it right-side up and you're ready to go. It's that easy. And the threads are very strong and the dish part screws on very securely.The loop at the top of the bottle makes it easy to hang. I used one of those elongated s-hooks that are used to hang a hanging pot from a branch or whatever and it works perfectly. A piece of nylon fishing line would work fine, too.I really am very pleased with this and I think it will be a hit with the birds (I just put it out today, so still waiting for the first customers). I'm hanging it next to my screened porch to keep the cats entertained. It's nice to find an affordable product like this that does what it says it will do, is nicely made and serves a good purpose. A great gift for your bird-feeding friends, too. I'll post some photos once the birds belly up to the bar.By the way, a few reviewers have said that they have had it up for a while and no takers yet. I suggest posting a sign nearby, pointing to the waterer. (Kidding.) It takes a little while for birds to feel safe around anything new in your yard. They see it, they know it's there, they'll come. If you want to attract them faster, try letting a hose drip into a bucket nearby for a few hours a day for a few days--birds are extremely attracted to moving water. If they think water is in the area, they will investigate more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This is a great idea, I love it & so nicely made!", "unixReviewTime": 1367366400, "reviewTime": "05 1, 2013", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

It looks snug enough to keep bees and wasps from getting in. My only concern was if the metallic red paint on the flowers is bright enough to draw hummingbirds. And it is, after a mere 5 days in the garden, this morning we had our first customer at this beautiful feeder. I ran to get a camera to capture the promised video, but a dad-gone robin plunked down on the deck railing adjacent to the feeder and the hummingbird flitted off. Not giving up, though.

This little guy is great for just about anything you're going to need it for.Now that I have an entire winter under my belt with the Snow Joe, I can honestly say that it performed well above what I ever expected from a plastic, electric unit.  We got some pretty impressive snows, last winter, up to 26 inches at a time of wet and heavy snow.  The fist time we got 12 inches, I expected to have to call my brother-in-law and have him lend me his gas unit.  But the Snow Joe handled it.  I had to take two passes to get the full 12 inches, taking about 6 inches, then backing up and getting it clean to the concrete.  But compared to a shovel, or a the hassle and cost of a two stage gas unit, it was great.  It even handled the packed and frozen stuff the city plow leaves in front of the curbside mailbox.  It's so light that if I need to reposition it, I just pick it up and carry it to the next place.  As far as cord issues, I find that this is really no more hassle than you have while vacuuming, and once you work out a system for your particular drive/sidewalk, it gets second nature.  I did store the unit in the house, since it was small enough.  I just put down a garbage bag, with an old towel on top, to catch the melt.  By the end of the 2012/2013 winter, the snow piles in our boulevard were to tall for me to see over, at 6'1\" tall, and our mailbox was accessed through a little hole we'd dug into that snow bank.  The Snow Joe had thrown all of it there, including the heavy piles left by the plow.  I worked it well above what the designers meant it to do, I'm sure, but it handled it.  Other than an occasional scratch from the odd rock and a missing sticker, or two, it barely looks used.Recommended, whole-heartedly, by this Wisconsinite, who's happy to no longer have to break his back, shoveling.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Passed the test in Wisconsin!", "unixReviewTime": 1370649600, "reviewTime": "06 8, 2013", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

I wasted too much money and time on those other things.After following the directions to &#34;season&#34; the tube and burn off left over oil from manufacturing, I put a couple pounds of cheese in my Masterbuilt Electric smoker and the Tube Smoker in the bottom.  I filled the Tube Smoker half full of pellets and fired it up.I DID NOT use any heat from the smoker itself for this test.  In fact I never plugged it in. The cheese will melt at just over 100 deg (F).  I wanted to see how much heat the Tube Smoker would generate because I want to use it for cold smoking.  I have a larger barrel style smoker I normally use for cold smoking because the heat source is well away from the food to be smoked.  Trying it in this smaller unit was just a test.The pellets lasted about 2.5 hours (half full).  There was enough heat generated to cause the cheese to soften but not melt.  I didn't think to put a thermometer inside so I don't know the exact temp.If I were to use the Tube Smoker in a BBQ grill for example, I would make sure the food to be smoked was as low as possible and plenty of air flow.  It does generate too much heat for a small, closed in space for cold smoking.It would work great in a BBQ grill to add smoke to your food.  If you're cooking steak, burgers, chicken.  I like to throw a couple pieces of Tri Tip (tied together) on the rotisserie and add wood chips to the coals.

This trimmer has more power and a better balance and feel. It is easier to switch from trimmer to edger than the GH600 and the telescoping shaft is nice. The GH600 had .065 line and I had hoped the .080 line on this trimmer would be much better and last longer. I am disappointed that it uses much more line than the GH600 did. If you let it hit the sidewalk or fence too much the spool will be empty before you know it. If you buy wound replacement spools they cost $ 7.50 each. I wind my own. 375 feet of high quality .080 line cost me $ 14.75. The GH600 had a wire guide to use when edging, this has a wheel. I don't like the wheel because if you don't watch it you'll be rolling the wheel right down the sidewalk with the line hitting the concrete all the way. The GH600 had a sturdy cord retention hook, this trimmer does not. The spool cap was easy to get off on the GH600, it is more difficult on this trimmer, to the point that I use a small screwdriver to push in on each side to release it. I don't totally dislike it but had hoped a newer design trimmer would be an overall improvement.After using it now for a few weeks I have to say I am really unhappy with it now.

Then, I placed the Plant Nanny in the soil and attached the water bottle (I use the Smart Water bottles with the labels peeled off - they are pretty sleek-looking and unobtrusive, so they aren't super noticeable in my yard).

Its primarily meant to help power or charge small mobile USB, AA or AAA devices like phones, small tablet computers, flashlights, radios etc and offers a great solution for those away from normal power sources beyond their devices battery life.It consists of:1) A Nomad 7 Solar panel.  This consists of two rigid 3.5 watt high efficiency solar panels in a sturdy folding ballistic nylon frame (kind of like a wallet but bigger) that contains the electronics and power connections along with a zippered mesh pouch on the back of one panel that can hold the rest of the kit and more.  The panel has a flap with a magnetic closure and several cord loops in various positions to allow you to hang or fasten the panel to something.2) The Gide 10 Plus Recharger.  This is a small plastic box that holds 4 NiMh Rechargeable AA batteries (included) (or 4 AAA batteries - not included) that can charge the batteries to accumulate and store the power from the solar panel, and then provide higher levels of consistent power to your USB devices.3) 4 AA Rechargeable 2300mah 1.2v NiMh Goal Zero branded batteries.  These have good capacity but as the instructions say to make sure to charge them every few months, they are likely not low self discharge (LSD) batteries like Sanyo Eneloops that can retain 75% of their charge after 3 years.4) An AAA adapter5) A 12v female cigarette lighter cable to allow the panel to directly power some 12 volt devicesEverything fits in the mesh compartment on the back of the solar panel and it forms a package about 7&#34;x9&#34;x1.5&#34; and weighing about 1lb 11oz.  There's plenty of room left in the pouch for the USB cables of whatever devices you might want to charge/power with this kit, more batteries etc and you'll still likely end up under 2 pounds.So what's good about this kit?  First off, its a kit thats easy to use, well designed and constructed, and contains all the bits an pieces you'll need (other than the USB cables specific to your devices).  As the panel is small and sunlight varies in strength the panel itself won't always consistently charge or power devices directly - so a power pack is included to accumulate/normalize/amplify that power and also make it available to USB devices when the sun isn't out.  And it doubles as a battery charger for AA or AAA batteries (although you have to charge 4 at a time).This is one of my favorite kits and I give it 4 stars.  Why only 4?  Well it is a bit bigger and heavier than it needs to be (see the PowerFilm AA and AA+USB units if you want the ultimate in tiny and light - but they are not as versatile).  The battery pack doesn't independently charge each battery but requires a set of 4 to charge anything.  The particular panel technology used is the most efficient in strong sunlight but in less ideal conditions it looses efficiency quickly (the PowerFilm panels are not as efficient in full sunlight but are much more efficient in less ideal conditions).I highly recommend this kit for an individual thats going to be &#34;off grid&#34; for a while that wants to continue to use a few small USB or AA or AAA devices.  If you have a lot of devices or want to power things for more than one person you might want to consider a bigger kit like the Sherpa 50.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great for Hiking, Camping and Emergency use of small USB or AA or AAA powered devices", "unixReviewTime": 1385769600, "reviewTime": "11 30, 2013", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

Product came well packaged, everything was in the box. The unit was very easy to assemble, with very little to do. It seems well built and sturdy. It started right up. It is lightweight, easy to handle, and uses very little fuel. The trimmer head comes with line thicker than most trimmers, it doesn go through as much as my past trimmer. I have several fences to trim against, including chain link. My old trim head went through a significant amount of line, this head is much more economical. The safety guard for the trimmer covers the line well but does not get n the way of trimming. The extra attachments I have for my Troy Bilt (Hedge trimmer, edger, Chainsaw) also fit on this trimmer, which is a plus. The only negative about the product I would say is that when new it doesn't seem to hold an idle really well. You have to keep on the throttle a bit to keep it running. That seems to be going away as it gets broken in.Over, this is a great trimmer to use around the yard, and a great value.

It is a clever design, and it does work with my very powerful Toro electric leaf blower as I describe below.I use it with an electric Toro blower. The blower is powerful enough to blow the adapter sock off the tapered blower attachment. After some experimenting I found the trick to make the connection very secure. 1) Slide the sock directly over blower port (with fan guard off, and buckle unthreaded). 2) Replace the fan guard over the sock, and 3) thread the rubber strap of the sock through the guard and tighten to secure it.The whole set up is very secure. I can hold the blower pipe with both hands with the Toro hanging off the bottom to blast the leaves and junk out of the gutters. The Toro-Worx combination does blast everything out of the gutter, esp. after the second pass. Once I figured out how to use it it got my gutters all blown out in just a few minutes. Much, much easier than running up and down a ladder.The piping is a bit flimsy. But that also makes it very light weight, so it is easy to get it up to your gutters, and to work with it without undo strain.
